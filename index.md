# 🔄 Enterprise Migration: Project Server → Project for the Web / Project Operations

**Seamlessly transform your legacy Microsoft Project environment** (Project Server 2013/2016/2019 or Project Online) into a modern, cloud-native solution with **Project for the Web** (Dataverse) or **Dynamics 365 Project Operations**—all without exposing proprietary code.

---

## ⭐ Why This Tool Matters

1. **Commercial-Grade Reliability**  
   - Fully tested across thousands of real-world projects.  
   - Zero data loss—tasks, assignments, resources, dependencies, and custom fields migrate intact.

2. **Turnkey & Maintenance-Free**  
   - No coding or scripting required on your end.  
   - Built-in updates and support included under subscription.  
   - Regularly updated to remain compatible with the latest Microsoft 365, Dataverse, and Dynamics 365 Project Operations releases.

3. **Enterprise-Ready Features**  
   - **End-to-End Data Fidelity**: Projects, tasks, custom calendars, enterprise resources, dependencies, and attachments.  
   - **High-Volume Performance**: Optimized for bulk migration (tens of thousands of tasks).  
   - **Transactional Integrity**: Automatic rollback on failure—never leave your environment in a partially migrated state.  
   - **Custom Field & Lookup Support**: Map any required field—no limitations on enterprise-specific metadata.  
   - **Dedicated Support & SLAs**: 24×7 enterprise support, guaranteed response times, and upgrade plans.

4. **Power Platform & Dataverse Native**  
   - Leverages Microsoft Dataverse for high-speed, secure data storage.  
   - Integrates seamlessly with Microsoft’s life-cycle management (tenant isolation, environment security).  
   - Post-migration, you can build custom Power Automate flows, Power BI dashboards, or Power Apps—everything lives within your existing Dataverse tenant.

5. **Avoid Manual Re-Entry**  
   - Save weeks (or months) of manual rebuilding.  
   - No need to retrain users on a brand-new data schema—our tool replicates your familiar Project Server structure directly into Project for the Web.
